# 📚 BookRoot 🌱  
**An intelligent Android lifestyle app for book insights, recommendations, and reader profiling**

BookRoot is a **machine learning–driven Android application** that uses book metadata and reader reviews to deliver **personalized recommendations, intelligent summaries, and reader behavior insights**.

The project focuses on **building robust ML/NLP models** and integrating them into a **native Android app built with Kotlin**, with the goal of publishing on the **Google Play Store**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build real-world **machine learning models** on book and review data  
- Apply **NLP** to understand reader sentiment and themes  
- Create a **recommendation system** for personalized book discovery  
- Design a **production-ready Android app**  
- Deploy and publish the app on the **Google Play Store**

## 🧠 Core Features (Planned)

### 📊 Book Analytics
- Book metadata analysis (author, genre, publication year, editions)  
- Genre and author trend analysis  
- Popularity indicators based on ratings and reviews  

### 🧾 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Sentiment analysis on book reviews  
- Topic modeling to extract major themes  
- AI-generated review summaries for quick understanding  

### 🤝 Recommendation System
- Content-based recommendations using embeddings  
- Collaborative filtering using ratings  
- Hybrid recommendation engine  
- “Books similar to what you like” suggestions  

### 👤 Reader Profiling & Clustering
- Cluster users based on reading preferences  
- Predict reader personas (e.g., Explorer, Comfort Reader, Literary Enthusiast)  
- Input: user’s favorite books or genres  

### 📈 Predictive Modeling
- Book popularity prediction using regression models  
- Explainable ML (feature importance)
